‚óè COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS - THE ROOT CAUSE

  Based on my deep dive, I now have a complete understanding of the substantial organizational issue. Here's my comprehensive
  report:

  ---
  1. EXECUTION FLOW ANALYSIS

  What Should Happen:

  1. Main goroutine executes go function() { setTimeout(...) }
  2. go function() spawns a child goroutine to execute __func_expr_0
  3. Child goroutine calls setTimeout(__func_expr_1, 4000)
  4. Timer is scheduled for 4 seconds
  5. After 4 seconds, timer fires and executes __func_expr_1 (console.log)

  What Actually Happens:

  1. Main goroutine executes go function() { setTimeout(...) }
  2. THE MAIN GOROUTINE ITSELF executes __func_expr_1 immediately
  3. No child goroutine is spawned
  4. No timer is scheduled
  5. Program crashes during cleanup

  2. THE ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUE

  Problem: Function Code Generation vs. Function Calls

  The core issue is a fundamental confusion between generating function code and calling functions:

  1. Function Expression Compilation (lines 1037-1084 in ast_codegen.cpp):
    - FunctionExpression::generate_code() compiles the function body immediately
    - This places the function's machine code directly in the current code stream
    - The function is compiled inline where it's encountered
  2. Goroutine Spawning (lines 1068-1072):
    - After compiling the function, if is_goroutine is true, it calls emit_goroutine_spawn()
    - But the function code has already been inlined into the current execution stream

  The Result:

  - The main function contains both the goroutine spawn call AND the inlined function code
  - When the main function executes, it runs the inlined code directly
  - The goroutine spawn call may never be reached or may be ineffective

  3. CODE PLACEMENT PROBLEMS

  Current Architecture Issues:

  1. No Code Separation: Function definitions are mixed with execution code
  2. Immediate Compilation: Functions are compiled where they're encountered, not in a separate section
  3. Memory Layout Chaos: The executable memory contains:
    - Main function at offset 0
    - __func_expr_0 at offset 24 (the setTimeout function)
    - __func_expr_1 at offset 45 (the console.log callback)
    - Main epilogue at offset 229

  The Fatal Flaw:

  The main function is calling the function code directly instead of calling the goroutine spawn mechanism. The function code
  is physically located after the spawn call in the executable memory, so it gets executed as part of the normal code flow.

  4. EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM

  Debug Output Analysis:

  DEBUG: emit_goroutine_spawn called with: __func_expr_0
  DEBUG: About to emit call to __goroutine_spawn with function name: __func_expr_0
  DEBUG: Generated call instruction for __goroutine_spawn

  This shows the goroutine spawn call is being generated.

  But then:
  DEBUG: Goroutine 0 starting execution
  DEBUG: Executing main function in main goroutine
  Go timeout done

  No debug output from __goroutine_spawn means the function is never called! The main function is executing the callback
  directly.

  5. ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTION NEEDED

  The System Needs:

  1. Code Section Separation:
    - Function Definition Section: All function code compiled first
    - Main Execution Section: Only execution logic, no function definitions
    - Proper Function Addressing: Functions accessible by address, not inline
  2. Proper Compilation Order:
    - Phase 1: Compile all function definitions
    - Phase 2: Generate function registry
    - Phase 3: Compile main execution code with proper function calls
  3. Function Call vs. Function Definition:
    - Function expressions should generate function addresses, not inline code
    - Goroutine spawning should call functions by address, not by name
    - Timer callbacks should use function addresses, not function IDs

  The Core Problem:

  The system is trying to do immediate compilation to avoid memory management issues, but this causes code organization chaos.
   Functions are being compiled inline instead of being separated into proper callable units.

  6. PROPOSED ORGANIZATIONAL METHOD

  Three-Phase Compilation Architecture:

  1. Phase 1 - Function Discovery:
    - Scan AST for all function expressions
    - Assign stable addresses in executable memory
    - Create function registry with addresses
  2. Phase 2 - Function Compilation:
    - Compile all function bodies to their assigned addresses
    - Register functions in runtime registry
    - Ensure no inline compilation
  3. Phase 3 - Execution Code Generation:
    - Generate main function with proper function calls
    - Use function addresses for goroutine spawning
    - Use function addresses for timer callbacks

  Memory Layout:

  [Function Section]
    __func_expr_0 at 0x100
    __func_expr_1 at 0x200
    ... other functions
  [Main Section]
    __main at 0x1000
    ... main execution code

  7. IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

  1. Stop Inline Function Compilation: Functions should not be compiled where they're encountered
  2. Fix Function Registry: Ensure functions are registered with addresses, not IDs
  3. Separate Code Sections: Physical separation of function definitions and execution code
  4. Fix Goroutine Spawning: Use function addresses, not names
  5. Fix Timer Callbacks: Use function addresses, not function IDs

  This is indeed a major architectural issue that requires significant refactoring of the compilation system. The current
  approach of immediate compilation is fundamentally incompatible with proper function separation and goroutine spawning.
